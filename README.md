# Railway_Management_System
In this project which i finished 2 years ago during the fall semester in university for Database class, i implemented the entities and endpoints for a server back-end Java application initialized with the Spring framework.

Important Prerequisites: Docker ( https://www.docker.com/get-started ) and JDK 14 is needed for this project.

Here is a list of API endpoints that i implemented: 

Input - fields that will be sent to the endpoint. 

Output - expected output of the endpoint.

P.S in Report.pdf file which i uploaded i describe the sql tables i used and designed and decisions i made during creation of the database. Check it our to fully understand it.
